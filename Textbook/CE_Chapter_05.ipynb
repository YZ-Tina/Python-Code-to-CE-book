In the case of a two-dimensional distribution, this program receives an array of integer values defining the number of points to use in each direction as first argument. We then pass an array of dimension $n_wn_R\\times2$ and one of dimension $n_wn_R$. The former stores the $\\tilde{w}$ and $\\tilde{R}_2$ quadrature nodes, the latter represents the respective weights. Compared to the one-dimentional case, we do not get $n_w$ nodes for $\\tilde{w}$ and $n_R$ nodes for $\\tilde{R}_2$ due to the possible correlation of the two variables. If the variables were e.g. positively correlated, then at least in tendency we can see that the larger $\\tilde{w}$, the larger $\\tilde{R}_2$. this fact can only be matched by assigning any approximatino value $w_i$ of $\\tilde{w}$ a separate set $R_{i,j}, j=1,\\dots,n_R$ of approximation values for $\\tilde{R}_2$.

    "### 5.2.2 Uncertain Lifespan and Annuity Choice\n",
    "Individuals face mortality risk over the life cycle. In order to insure against the risk of outliving one's resources, they may buy <i>annuity</i> contracts that pay out a lot more compared to regular assets in the event that the household dies very late. In the following, we will introduce uncertain lifespan into the life-cycle model. We assusme the probability of an individual aged $i$ to die within the current period is denoted by $q_i$. The household will survive with probability $\\psi_2=1-q_1$ from period 1 to 2 and, conditional on having survived to period 2, the individual only lives up to period 3 with probability $\\psi_3=1-q_2$. In order to insure agaist the risk of longevity, he mmight puchase annuities. The price of an annuity contract brought in the first or second period of life that pays 1 euro in all future periods is $$p_{a,1}=\\frac{\\psi_2}{R}+\\frac{\\psi_2\\psi_3}{R^2} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad p_{a,2}=\\frac{\\psi_3}{R}.$$ We assume that the annuity market is perfectly competitive and abstract from systemetic mortality risk, insurers will not run any surplus. Therefore, for one unit of income invested in annuities at period $i$, the household will receive a constant income stream of $\\frac{1}{p_{a,i}}$ in all remaining future periods."

    "Beneath choosing the optimal asset level, the agent now also has to decide about which fraction $\\omega_i$ of the saving s to invest in annuities. The remaining part of assets $1-\\omega_i$ will be invested in regular assets at a fixed rate $R$. Hence, the optimization problem turns into $$\\max_{a_2, \\omega_1, \\tilde{a}_3, \\tilde{\\omega}_2} u(c_1)+\\psi_2\\beta E[u(\\tilde{c}_2)+\\psi_3\\beta u(\\tilde{c_3})],$$ where expectations now not only are formed with respect to labour-income uncertainty but also with repect to survival. The household therefore only receive utility in a certain period if he survives. We assume that assets have to be greater than a lower threshold $\\underline{a}$. With this assumption, we can loosen households borrowing limit of $a \\geq 0$ imposed in earlier programs. The budget constraints finally turn into \\begin{equation}\n",
