# Python-Code-to-CE-book
This repository converts the Fortran codes in Fehr and Kindermann (2018), ["Introduction to Computational Economics Using Fortran, Oxford University Press."](https://www.ce-fortran.com/) to Python codes.

The codes are in Jupyter notebook style.

This is still an ongoing project.
